# JARVIS - Just a Rather Very Smart System

Jarvis is an attempt to build an Artificial intelligent virtual assistant that
will be able to help user performing day to day tasks and promoting touch free
computing as user will be able to contol computers using voice and gesture
commands.After the Beta versions it is planned to be control house and IOT
devices and might be able to run on low computing devices like rasbery pi.

It compilation on the concept of modules where each module performs a separate
task and Handel's a different function which gives Jarvis a huge amount of error
tolerance as if one module malfunctions there is little to no impact on the
rest.

### List of Modules include :-

- Jarvis -- Jarvis Is nothing but just a chatbot that talk with user by
  accepting voice commands from user and then provides an appropriate response
  to the user and even controls diffrent products to know more about dumce click

- <a href="https://github.com/DevelopedByAnurag/Vision">VISION</a> -- A gesture
  control system built on the top of computer vision that recognizes user
  gestures and take appropriate actions to know about working and gesture
  commands click here

## Special Thanks :-

I would like to Special Thanks to my mentor, @stackOverflow, who guided me to
fix all the bugs and provided great suggestions to improve the bot. I would also
like to say thanks to my Guide @Kaggle, which helped to get datasets and guide
from the community. They both put a tremendous effort to help me make this
project bug free but still if you find a problem you can pig me by simply
creating a issue.
